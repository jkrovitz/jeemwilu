<p><strong>Vision and Planning:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This application visualizes the refractory changes that take place as a crystal is rotated along the axis of a polarized light beam that is projected from the bottom-up. The user drags to rotate a crystal 360 degrees around its fixed point. As it rotates, updates are made to the crystal&rsquo;s optical indicatrix - shown by an ellipsoid that rotates along with the crystal (shown on the left and middle of the window). Changes made to the indicatrix&rsquo;s orientation modify the height and width of its central cross section (shown on the middle and the right).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All elements are rendering simultaneously, giving the user the ability to visualize how every aspect of the crystal changes as its dragged in any direction.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outstanding bugs/issues/missing features for this application as of 12/18/2017 are as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The middle-shape cross section does not expand perfectly to fit the ellipsoid - there&rsquo;s a little bit of overlap that needs to be corrected</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More prism shapes and cross sections can be added as features</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile device porting could be enabled</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">App is only working verifiably on Chrome browser, other browser testing and implementation could be done</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is known issue with Safari where objects are not being removed from the canvas correctly</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key controls could be implemented in addition to mouse controls</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UI/Design aesthetic improvements could be made with more time</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design and functionality ideas for this app at the beginning of the semester match our final project almost exactly. Future development on this app should be primarily concerned with added un-implemented crystal structures</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>User Teaching/Documentation:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This app is intended for use by experienced geology students who will have background education on what each of the crystal properties are and what they represent. Here is a quick set of definitions for each element:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Crystal: Represented by the changeable 3D wireframe structure. The crystal is main element that is dragged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Optical Indicatrix: Represented by the two ellipsoids (one freestanding and one embedded). The optical indicatrix describes the refractory property of the crystal, it is not an actual feature of it. It rotates along with the crystal and shows how the polarized light is refracted via its cross section.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>FAQ/Miscellaneous Help</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to launch this app:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This app is launched by opening the &lsquo;index.html&rsquo; file included in the repository.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U/I Overview:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app launches into a screen with four buttons at the top, a switch below, and a crystal and ellipsoid shown in the middle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clicking a button will load the crystal structure that it represents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A crystal can be rotated by holding down the mouse and dragging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The switch turns the light beam on/off - i.e. it toggles the appearance of the cross section on/off</span></p>
